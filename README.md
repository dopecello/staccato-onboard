# Staccato: Musician Onboarding

This project is very much a work in progress!

## Local Setup
**TODO:** Elaborate on each step as this project goes public.
1. Download EnvFile for IntelliJ IDEA
2. Create a `dev.env` folder in the root of the project and set it up like this. (Make sure to fill in your own credentials within the `<...>`'s:
```
ROOT_USER=<...>
ROOT_PW=<...>
ADMIN_USER=<...>
ADMIN_PASS=<...>
```
3. Do File --> Save All, then run the `docker-compose.yaml` file. 
4. Next, go to `Edit Configurations...` before you run the program, and set up your configurations like this:

Make sure to hit `Apply` and `OK` before running the application.
5. Run the application and check to see if there are any errors. If you have issues, please let me know in the issues section of the repository.
